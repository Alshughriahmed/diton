These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the DitonaChat website (www.ditonachat.com) and related services (collectively, the "Service"), operated by [Company Legal Name] ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms.
